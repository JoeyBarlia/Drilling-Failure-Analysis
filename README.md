# Drilling-Failure-Analysis

Analysis of drilling operation data. 

## Dataset
The dataset is from Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raphaelwallsberger/xai-drilling-dataset

## Descriptive Analysis

What are the most common types of failures?

What is the occurence of multiple failures at once?

What is the percentage of failures represented by each material?

What is the percentage of failures represented by each drill bit type?

Which columns are most highly correlated?

Hypothesis tests to see if there is a significant difference in power consumption between drill bit types and material.

## Technical Modeling
### The goal is to predict when a machine will fail.

### The baseline random forest performed the best (99.7% accuracy). The ANN performed slighly worse.
